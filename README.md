# Browsing-Browser

I built a Chrome Exentension that uses a classification model to detect when I am in front of the browser or not. The extension takes photographs when it detects me getting up from and sitting down in front of the browser. These photographs are then uploaded to a Twitter account, alongside cheery reponses from the bot itself. The application serves as a documentation of my internet browsing experience. Through this format, I have control over how much of my relationship to the internet I reveal to the world around me, transforming surveillance into a form of documentation.
